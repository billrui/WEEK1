    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Bill Kiprop, and I am currently learning full-stack web development at mctaba Labs .
        This course is helping me build practical skills in both frontend and backend technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        By week 30, my goal is to build and deploy a complete full-stack web application
        that solves a real-world problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        My target users are individuals and small businesses who need simple, reliable,
        and easy-to-use web solutions.
    </p>
